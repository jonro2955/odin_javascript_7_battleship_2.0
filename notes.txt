AI Algorithm description:

The function smartMove(board) finds an undestroyed ship on the board and hits 
an adjacent end cell on it. A ship is any 'hit' cell that is either single or 
connected by other hit cells in a straight line. The way the program knows if a ship is 
sunk is if there are missed shots on both ends of the ship. 

Everytime smartMove(board) is called, the program finds an unsunk ship on 
the board and attacks one of its end cell openings. Then it checks if it is sunk.
Once a ship is sunk, we save its cell coordinates in an ignore list 
so that it is no longer considered by future iterations of this function.
Restarting the game empties the ignore list..

AI Algorithm Steps:

1) if (a) there's no moves yet or (b) there's no hit moves in 'moves', then
  execute randomAttack(board).
 
2) Get the first hit move in moves that is not destroyed: bow'. 
Push it into a special ship container called 'enemyShip'. 

3) a)If bow has an adjacent hit cell 'stern', push it into enemyShip. 
The directions to look for stern in depends on
the location of bow:
* If bow is a corner cell such as (0,0), there are 2 adjacent options:
* E = (1, 0) and S = (0, 1).
* If bow is an edge cell, there are 3 options.
* If bow is any other cell, you have all 4 options: N, E, S, W.
b) If bow has no adjacent hit cell, it's a single hit. 
  return hitAdjacent(bow) (strikes an adjacent open cell of bow at random)* END
 
4) At this point, enemyShip has 2 adjacent hit coords: bow and stern.
Sort enemyShip depending on the orientation of its 2 current coords.
Using a continuous loop, look to either ends of the 2 coordinates
and if there are any hit cells, continuoulsy push them into enemyShip 
(need directional operations to go in the correct 2 directions) until you 
cannot find anymore or run into a wall. 

5) Now enemyShip represents a strip cluster of red connected cells.
If there no moves have been made at the ends of this ship, that is the 
next move. 
  Pick one end and hit it* END
If there is no empty cell at either end of this ship, currentEnemyCoords 
is destroyed. Mark these coordinates as 'destroyed' and 
  return randomAttack(board). END

*: Note we cannot hit an end/adjacent if it's beyond grid bounds.
